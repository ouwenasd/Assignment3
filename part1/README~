For part 1, I choose three books:
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-h/76-h.htm
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/135/135-h/135-h.htm
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/844/844-h/844-h.htm

Modification:
1. I strip out all style from these htmls, and put them into css file.
It includes all things in style tags, and something in img tags, like
width.
2. I change the background of htmls.
3. I change the font-style of htmls into serif.
4. I add frmae to all images.
